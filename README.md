Maze Solver
This repository contains Python code for solving a maze using two different approaches: breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).

Description
The code consists of two main functions:

Maze(matrix)

This function solves the maze using breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
It takes a matrix as input, where the maze is represented as a grid of 1s (path) and 0s (obstacle).
The function returns the number of valid paths from the start to the exit of the maze.
Mazedfs(matrix)

This function solves the maze using depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
It takes a matrix as input, similar to the Maze() function.
The function returns a list of coordinates representing a valid path from the start to the exit of the maze.
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-solver.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd maze-solver
Open the code file (maze_solver.py) and modify the matrix variable to define your maze.

Run the code:

bash
Copy code
python maze_solver.py
The output will display the number of valid paths found by the BFS algorithm and the list of coordinates representing the path found by the DFS algorithm.

Dependencies
The code requires the collections module from the Python standard library.
